# SKF-Chatbot
# GSOC-2K18 Project
Security Knowledge Framework (SKF) is a tool that is used as a guide for building and verifying secure
software. It can also be used to train developers about application security. The OWASP Security Knowledge
Framework is an expert system web-application that uses the OWASP Application Security Verification
Standard and other resources. It can be used to support developers in pre-development (security by design) as
well as after code is released (OWASP ASVS Level 1-3).
Chatbots are software agents that interact with the user in a conversation. A chatbot is a service which is
provided by websites so that users can easily able to fetch information interactively. They can reach out to a
large audience on messaging apps and be more effective. A chatbot provides a speedy and quick response and
available around the clock. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would
behave as a conversational partner. Chatbot will be an attempt to reduce the pain of the user and will help
users in finding solutions to their problems and thus improving the security of code and infrastructure. This
will be integrated into various chat systems to make it easier to use.
