{"Id": 1, "Ques": ["What is Filename injection Path traversel ?", "What does Filename injection Path traversel mean ?", "Tell me something about Filename injection Path traversel ?", "Filename injection Path traversel"],"Ans": "A Path Traversal attack aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By browsing the application, the attacker looks for absolute links to files stored on the web server. By manipulating variables that reference files with dotdotslash (../); sequences and its variations, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and critical system files, limited by system operational access control. The attacker uses  ../../ sequences to move up to root directory, thus permitting navigation through the file system. This attack can be executed with an external malicious code injected on the path, like the Resource Injection attack."},
{"Id": 2, "Ques": ["What is xss injection ?", "What does xss injection mean ?", "Tell me something about xss injection ?", "xss injection"],"Ans": "Every time the application gets userinput, whether this showing it on screen or processing\nthis data in the application background, these parameters should be escaped for malicious\ncode in order to prevent crosssite scripting injections.\nWhen an attacker gains the possibility to perform an XSS injection,\nhe is given the opportunity to inject HTML and JavaScript code directly into the\napplication. This could lead to accounts being compromised by stealing session cookies or directly affect the operation of the target application."},
{"Id": 3, "Ques": ["What is Command injection ?", "What does Command injection mean ?", "Tell me something about Command injection ?", "Command injection"],"Ans": "Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on\nthe host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are\npossible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data\n(forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack,\nthe attackersupplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges\nof the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to\ninsufficient input validation. This attack differs from Code Injection, in that code\ninjection allows the attacker to adds his own code that is then executed by the application.\nIn Code Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application\nwithout the necessity of executing system commands."},
{"Id": 4, "Ques": ["What is Cross site request forgery ?", "What does Cross site request forgery mean ?", "Tell me something about Cross site request forgery ?", "Cross site request forgery"],"Ans": "CrossSite Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious Web site,\nemail, blog, instant message, or program causes a users Web browser to perform an unwanted\naction on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated."},

{"Id": 8, "Ques": ["What is XSLT injections ?", "What does XSLT injections mean ?", "Tell me something about XSLT injections ?", "XSLT injections"],"Ans": "A vulnerability occurs when an XSL file is loaded from a source controlled by an attacker.\nWhen the attacker is given the opportunity to specify the source of the included XSL file\nhe could include a file which contains malicious code to be parsed on the target application.\nThis could lead to, code execution, reading arbitrary files and many more\nvulnerabilities such as XSS."},
{"Id": 9, "Ques": ["What is External DTD parsing ?", "What does External DTD parsing mean ?", "Tell me something about External DTD parsing ?", "External DTD parsing"],"Ans": "Processing of an external entity containing tainted data may lead to the disclosure of confidential information and other system impacts. The XML 1.0 standard defines the structure of an XML document. The standard defines a concept called an entity, which is a storage unit of some type. There exists a specific type of entity, an external general parsed entity often shortened to an external entity that can access local or remote content via a declared system identifier. The system identifier is assumed to be a URI that can be dereferenced (accessed) by the XML processor when processing the entity.\nThe XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system identifier. If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML processor dereferences this tainted data, the XML processor may disclose confidential information normally not accessible by the application. Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\nSince the attack occurs relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems, possibly disclosing other internal content via HTTP(s) requests. In some situations, an XML processor library that is vulnerable to clientside memory corruption issues may be exploited by dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code execution under the application account. Other attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability if too many threads or processes are not released."},
