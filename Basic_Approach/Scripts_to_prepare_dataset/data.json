			"title": "Filename injection Path traversel",
			"Description": "A Path Traversal attack aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By browsing the application, the attacker looks for absolute links to files stored on the web server. By manipulating variables that reference files with dotdotslash (../); sequences and its variations, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and critical system files, limited by system operational access control. The attacker uses  ../../ sequences to move up to root directory, thus permitting navigation through the file system. This attack can be executed with an external malicious code injected on the path, like the Resource Injection attack.",
			"Solution": "The most effective solution to eliminate file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing usersubmitted input to any filesystem/framework API. If this is not possible the application can maintain a white list of files, that may be included on the page, and then use an identifier (for example the index number) to access the selected file. Any request containing an invalid identifier has to be rejected, in this way there is no attack surface for malicious users to manipulate the path."

			"title": "xss injection",
			"Description": "Every time the application gets userinput, whether this showing it on screen or processingthis data in the application background, these parameters should be escaped for maliciouscode in order to prevent crosssite scripting injections.When an attacker gains the possibility to perform an XSS injection,he is given the opportunity to inject HTML and JavaScript code directly into theapplication. This could lead to accounts being compromised by stealing session cookies or directly affect the operation of the target application.",
			"Solution": "In order to prevent XSS injections, all userinput should be escaped or encoded.You could start by sanitizing userinput as soon as it is inserted into the application,by preference using a so called whitelisting method.This means you should not check for malicious content like the tags or anything,but only allow the expected input. Every input which is outside of the intended operationof the application should immediately be detected and login rejected.Do not try to help use the input in any way because that could introduce a new type of attack by converting characters. The second step would be encoding all the parameters or userinput before putting this inyour html with encoding libraries specially designed for this purpose.You should take into consideration that there are several contexts for encoding userinput forescaping XSS injections. These contexts are amongst others:HTML encoding is for whenever your userinput is displayed directly into your HTML.HTML attribute encoding is the type of encoding/escaping that should be applied whenever your user input is displayed into the attribute of your HTML tags.HTML URL encoding ;This type of encoding/escaping should be applied to whenever you are using userinput into a HREF tag.JavaScript encoding should be used whenever parameters are rendered via JavaScript; your application will detect normal injections in the first instant. But your application still remains vulnerable to JavaScript encoding which will not be detected by the normal encoding/escaping methods."

			"title": "Command injection",
			"Description": "Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands onthe host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks arepossible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data(forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack,the attackersupplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privilegesof the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due toinsufficient input validation. This attack differs from Code Injection, in that codeinjection allows the attacker to adds his own code that is then executed by the application.In Code Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the applicationwithout the necessity of executing system commands.",
			"Solution": "Userinput that is used in a shell command should not contain dangerous characters.A blacklist of characters is not a good option because it may be difficult to think ofall of the characters to validate against. A white list containing only allowablecharacters should be created to validate the userinput."

For example, this attack could resultin a transfer of funds, changing a password, or purchasing an item in the users context.In effect, CSRF attacks are used by an attacker to make a target system perform afunction (funds Transfer, form submission etc.) via the targets browser withoutknowledge of the target user at least until the unauthorised function has been committed.",
			"Solution": "To arm an application against automated attacks and tooling you need to use unique tokenswhich are included into the forms of an application, API calls or AJAX requests.  Any state changing operation requires a secure random token (e.g CSRF token) to preventagainst CSRF attacks. Characteristics of a CSRF Token are a unique, large randomvalue generated by a cryptographically secure random number generator.The CSRF token is then added as a hidden field for forms and validated on the sever side whenevera user is sending a request to the server.Note :Whenever the application is an REST service and is using tokens such as JWT tokens, whenever these tokens are being sentin the application headers rather than stored in cookies the application should not be suspectible to CSRF attacks for a succesfull CSRF attacke depends on the browsers cookie jar."

			"title": "External DTD parsing",
			"Description": "Processing of an external entity containing tainted data may lead to the disclosure of confidential information and other system impacts. The XML 1.0 standard defines the structure of an XML document. The standard defines a concept called an entity, which is a storage unit of some type. There exists a specific type of entity, an external general parsed entity often shortened to an external entity that can access local or remote content via a declared system identifier. The system identifier is assumed to be a URI that can be dereferenced (accessed) by the XML processor when processing the entity.The XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system identifier. If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML processor dereferences this tainted data, the XML processor may disclose confidential information normally not accessible by the application. Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.Since the attack occurs relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems, possibly disclosing other internal content via HTTP(s) requests. In some situations, an XML processor library that is vulnerable to clientside memory corruption issues may be exploited by dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code execution under the application account. Other attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability if too many threads or processes are not released.",

			"title": "LDAP injection",
			"Description": "LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) Injection is an attack used to exploit web based applications that construct LDAP statements based on user input. When an application fails to properly sanitize user input, it is possible to modify LDAP statements using a local proxy. This could result in the execution of arbitrary commands such as granting permissions to unauthorized queries, and content modification inside the LDAP tree. The same advanced exploitation techniques available in SQL Injection can be similarly applied in LDAP Injection.",
			"Solution": "The best way to prevent LDAP injection is to use a positive validation scheme for ensuring that the data going into your queries does not contain any attacks. However, in some cases, it is necessary to include special characters in the input that is passed into an LDAP query. In this case, using escaping can prevent the LDAP interpreter from thinking those special characters are actually part of the LDAP query."

			"title": "File upload injections",
			"Description": "Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications.The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked.Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file uploadhelps the attacker accomplish the first step.The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including complete system takeover,an overloaded file system or database, forwarding attacks to backend systems, and simpledefacement.There are really two classes of problems here.The first is with the file metadata, like the path and file name.These are generally provided by the transport, such as HTTP multipart encoding.This data may trick the application into overwriting a critical file or storing the filein a bad location. You must validate the metadata extremely carefully before using it.The other class of problem is with the file size or content.An attacker can easily craft a valid image file with PHP code inside.",
			"Solution": "Uploaded files always need to be placed outside the document root of the webserver.You should also check the userinput(filename) for having the rightallowed extensions such as .jpg, .png etc.Note: when checking these extensions always make sure your application validates the lastpossible extension so an attacker could not simply inject \".jpg.php\"and bypass yourvalidationAfter this validation, you must also check the userinput(filename) for containing possiblepath traversal patterns in order to prevent him from uploading outside ofthe intended directory.Most developers also do a mimetype check. This is a good protection however notwhenever you are checking this mimetype through the post request. This header can not betrusted since it can be easily manipulated by an attacker.The best way to check the mimetypeis to extract the file from the server after uploading and check it from the file itself.Deleting it whenever it does not comply with expected values.You may also want to check if the filenames do already exist before uploading in order toprevent the overwriting of files.Also for serving the files back there needs to be a file handler function that can selectthe file based on an identifier that will serve the file back towards the user."

As a result,when your software is not upgraded to the latest available version,script kiddies could easily compromise your application by following theexploit tutorials online, thus compromising your application.",
			"Solution": "One option is not to use components that you did not write.But that is not very realistic.Most component projects do not create vulnerability patches for old versions.Instead, most simply fix the problem in the next version. So upgrading to these newversions is critical.Software projects should have a process in place to:Identify all components and the versions you are using, including all dependencies.(e.g., the versions plugin).Monitor the security of these components in public databases,project mailing lists, and security mailing lists, and keep them up to date.Establish security policies governing components use, such as requiring certain softwaredevelopment practices, passing security tests, and acceptable licenses.Where appropriate, consider adding security wrappers around components to disable unusedfunctionality and/ or secure weak or vulnerable aspects of the component.This also goes for all other components that should be up to date with proper securityconfiguration(s) and version(s) such as server OS etc.This should include removal of unneeded configurations and folders such as sampleapplications, platform documentation, and default or example users."

Because this process is difficult to reverse (similar to a cryptographic hash function)but can also be configured to be slow to compute, key derivation functions are ideally suited for password hashing use cases.Another alternative would be bcrypt. bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazières, based on the Blowfish cipher, and presented at USENIX in 1999. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to bruteforce search attacks even with increasing computation power."

It's creatingan extra layer of security where an attacker first needs to break out from.",
			"Solution": "Examples of sandbox implementations include the following:A jail: networkaccess restrictions, and a restricted file system namespace. Jails are most commonly used in virtual hosting.Rulebased execution gives users full control over what processes are started, spawned (by other applications), or allowed to inject code into other applications and have access to the net, by having the system assign access levels to users or programs according to a set of determined rules. It also can control file/registry security (what programs can read and write to the file system/registry). In such an environment, viruses and Trojans have fewer opportunities of infecting a computer. The SELinux and AppArmor security frameworks are two such implementations for Linux.Virtual machines emulate a complete host computer, on which a conventional operating system may boot and run as on actual hardware. The guest operating system runs sandboxed in the sense that it does not function natively on the host and can only access host resources through the emulator.Sandboxing on native hosts: Security researchers rely heavily on sandboxing technologies to analyze malware behavior  By creating an environment that mimics or replicates the targeted desktops, researchers can evaluate how malware infects and compromises a target host. Numerous malware analysis services are based on the sandboxing technology.Capability systems can be thought of as a finegrained sandboxing mechanism, in which programs are given opaque tokens when spawned and have the ability to do specific things based on what tokens they hold. Capabilitybased implementations can work at various levels, from kernel to userspace. An example of capabilitybased userlevel sandboxing involves HTML rendering in a Web browser.Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) is a sandbox built in the Linux kernel. When activated, seccomp only allows the write(), read(), exit(), and sigreturn() system calls.HTML5 has a \"sandbox\"attribute for use with iframes.Java virtual machines include a sandbox to restrict the actions of untrusted code, such as a Java applet.The .NET Common Language Runtime provides Code Access Security to enforce restrictions on a untrusted code.```"

			"Solution": "CrossOrigin requests have an Origin header, that identifies the domain initiating the request and is always sent to the server. CORS defines the protocol to use a web browser and a server to determine whether a crossorigin request is allowed. In order to accomplish this goal, there are a few HTTP headers involved in this process, that are supported by all major browsers: Origin AccessControlRequestMethod AccessControlRequestHeaders AccessControlAllowOrigin AccessControlAllowCredentials AccessControlAllowMethods AccessControlAllowHeadersThings you must consider when using CORS1. Validate URLs passed to XMLHttpRequest.open. Current browsers allow these URLs to becross domain; this behavior can lead to code injection by a remote attacker. Pay extraattention to absolute URLs.2. Ensure that URLs responding with AccessControlAllowOrigin: * do not include anysensitive content or information that might aid an attacker in further attacks.Use the AccessControlAllowOrigin header only on chosen URLs that need to beaccessed crossdomain. Don't use the header for the whole domain.3. Allow only selected, trusted domains in the AccessControlAllowOrigin header.Prefer whitelisting domains over blacklisting or allowing any domain(do not use * wildcard nor blindly return the Origin header content without any checks)4. Keep in mind that CORS does not prevent the requested data from going to anunauthenticated location. It's still important for the server to perform usualCSRF prevention.5. While the RFC recommends a preflight request with the OPTIONS verb, currentimplementations might not perform this request, so it's important that \"ordinary\"(GET and POST) requests perform any access control necessary.6. Discard requests received over plain HTTP with HTTPS origins to prevent mixedcontent bugs.7. Don't rely only on the Origin header for Access Control checks. Browser always sendsthis header in CORS requests, but may be spoofed outside the browser.Applicationlevel protocols should be used to protect sensitive data.**NOTE:** Modern application frameworks do dynamically allocation of the origin header, resulting in the browseralso allowing to send the \"AccessControlAllowCredentials: true\"header as well in requests. Whenever JSON web tokens are being send in cookies rather than headers, potential attackers could abuse this behaviour to make unauthenticated XHR get requests on the authenticated users behalf to read sensitive information from the pages."

			"Solution": " Verify that forms containing credentials are not filled in bythe application. Prefilling by the application implies thatcredentials are stored in plaintext or a reversible format,which is explicitly prohibited. Passwords should be stored by preferably PBKDF functions.PBKDF2 uses a pseudorandom function and a configurable number of iterations to derive acryptographic key from a password. Because this process is difficult to reverse(similar to a cryptographic hash function) but can also be configured to be slow to compute, key derivation functions are ideally suited for password hashing use cases.Examples of good ways to store passwords are with, BCRYPT, Blowfish or in some cases SCRYPTwhich is a little harder to implement correctlyNOTE: Password prefilling also happens when using the browsers password manager.

			"Solution": "The recommended solutions are to use TOTP (Timebased OneTime Password algorithm). This method is an example of a hashbased message authentication code (HMAC). It combines a secret key with the current timestamp using a cryptographic hash function to generate a onetime password. Because network latency and outofsync clocks can result in the password recipient having to try a range of possible times to authenticate against, the timestamp typically increases in 30second intervals, which thus cuts the potential search space.Or the other option is to use a Mathematicalalgorithmbased onetime password method. This other type of onetime password uses a complex mathematical algorithm, such as a hash chain, to generate a series of onetime passwords from a secret shared key. Each password cannot be guessed even when previous passwords are known. The open source OAuth algorithm is standardized; other algorithms are covered by U.S. patents. Each password is observably unpredictable and independent on previous ones. Therefore, an adversary would be unable to guess what the next password may be, even with the knowledge of all previous passwords.Example of a hard token mathimatical algorithm would be a yubikeyExample of a soft token TOTP would be google authenticatorThe last resort would be to send a new password by email. This mail should contain a reset link with a token which is valid for a limited amount of time. Additional authentication based on softtokens (e.g. SMS token, native mobile applications, etc.) can be required as well before the link is sent over.

Instead of solely dependingon role based authentication methods using sessions, we rather want to assign privilegesto users by means of a DatabaseBased Authentication system.We still use sessions in order to identify if the user was logged in correctly, only nowinstead of assigning that user with a specific role we assign him with privileges toverify which actions he is privileged to perform on the system.Also, a big pro of this method is, whenever a user has to be assigned fewer privilegesyour changes will be applied on the fly since the assigning does not depend on the sessionwhich otherwise had to expire first."

The key used to protect the transmission of data must not be used to derive any additional keys, and if the key used to protect the transmission of data is derived from some other keying material, then that material must not be used to derive any more keys. In this way, compromise of a single key permits access only to data protected by that single key.",
			"Solution": "In the beginning SSL handshake, the client sends a list of supported cipher suites (among other things). The server then picks one of the cipher suites, based on a ranking, and tells the client which one they will be using.This step is the one that determines whether or not the future connection will have perfect forward secrecy. Note that, at this point, certificates have not entered the picture at all. This is because whether or not a connection has perfect forward secrecy is determined by how the session key is derived. And how the session key is derived is determined by the cipher suite in use. So, the cipher suites that use ephemeral DiffieHellman (DHE) or the elliptic curve variant (ECDHE) will have perfect forward secrecy while the other options will not."

			"Solution": "Stapling basically means that the certificate holder queries the OCSP server themselves atregular intervals, obtaining a signed timestamped OCSP response. When the site's visitorsattempt to connect to the site, this response is included (\"stapled\") with the TLS/SSLHandshake via the Certificate Status Request extension response (note: the TLS client mustexplicitly include a Certificate Status Request extension in its ClientHello TLS/SSLhandshake message). While it may appear that allowing the site operator to controlverification responses would allow a fraudulent site to issue false verification for arevoked certificate, the stapled responses can't be forged as they need to be directlysigned by the certificate authority, not the server. If the client does not receive astapled response, it will just contact the OCSP server by itself. However, if theclient receives an invalid stapled response, it will abort the connection. The onlyincreased risk of OCSP stapling is that the notification of revocation for a certificatemay be delayed until the lastsigned OCSP response expires.For more detailed information about Specification, Deployment, and limitation visit:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling"

Although most examples point to vulnerable PHP scripts, we should keepin mind that it is also common in other technologies such as JSP, ASP and others.",

			"title": "Content security policy headers",
			"Description": "The main use of the content security policy header is to, detect, report, and reject XSS attacks. The core issue in relation to XSS attacks is the browser's inability to distinguish between a script that's intended to be part of your application, and a script that's been maliciously injected by a thirdparty.With the use of CSP(Content Security policy), we can tell the browser which script is safe to execute and which scripts are most likely been injected by an attacker.",
			"Solution": "A best practice for implementing CSP in your application would be to externalize allJavaScript within the web pages.So this:    ```    <script>      function doSomething() {        alert('Something!');      }\t</script>\t<button onclick='doSomething();'>foobar!</button>```Must become this:```\t<script src='doSomething.js'></script>\t<button id='somethingToDo'>Let's foobar!</button>```The header for this code could look something like:    ```    ContentSecurityPolicy: defaultsrc'self'; objectsrc'none'; scriptsrc'https://mycdn.com'    ```Since it is not entirely realistic to implement all JavaScript on external pages we can apply sort of a crosssite request forgery token to your inline JavaScript. This way the browser can again distinguish the difference between code which is part of the application against probable malicious injected code, in CSP this is called the 'nonce'. Of course, this method is also very applicable on your existing code and designs.Now, to use this nonce you have to supply your inline script tags with the nonce attribute. Firstly, it's important that the nonce changes for each response. Otherwise, the nonce would become guessable. So it should also contain a high entropy and should be hard to predict. Similar to the operation of the CSRF tokens, the nonce becomes impossible for the attacker to predict making it difficult to execute a successful XSS attack.Inline JavaScript example containing nonce:\t```\t<script nonce=sfsdf03nceI23wlsgle9h3sdd21>    <! Your javscript code >    </script>    ```Matching header example:    ```    ContentSecurityPolicy: scriptsrc 'noncesfsdf03nceI23wlsgle9h3sdd21'    ```There is a whole lot more to learn about the CSP header for indepth implementation in your application. This knowledge base item just scratches the surface and it would be highly recommended to gain more indepth knowledge about this powerful header Very Important:When applying the CSP header, although it blocks XSS attacks. Yourapplication still remains vulnerable to HTML and other code injections.So this is not a substitute for, validation, sanitizing and encoding of userinput."

In particular, you must support HTTPS for the www subdomain if a DNS record for that subdomain exists.5. Serve an HSTS header on the base domain for HTTPS requests:    The maxage must be at least eighteen weeks (10886400 seconds).    The includeSubDomains directive must be specified.    The preload directive must be specified.    If you are serving an additional redirect from your HTTPS site, that redirect must still have the HSTS     header (rather than the page it redirects to).Now the following parameter can be added to the HSTS header,maintained by Chrome (and used by Firefox and Safari), then use:    StrictTransportSecurity: maxage=31536000; includeSubDomains; preloadThe 'preload' flag indicates the site owner's consent to have their domain preloaded. The site ownerstill needs to then go and submit the domain to the list. CAUTION:Make sure to have a perfectly smooth certification management.

The failing ofthe TLS certificate will lead to a DOS since HSTS does not allow the application to be visited over HTTP"

			"title": "Identify and use only require functions if using components",
			"Description": "Applications have many different components that are needed for the business functions or for the security functions they provide. With many different components, there arealso possible vulnerabilities that can arise. Also, most of the components functions that are delivered are not necessary needed and can introduce a vulnerability in a specific partthat may not be even used by the application. Also, these security issues in the components are publicly well know and documented. ",
			"Solution": "The best approach in minimizing the possible security issues that can arise in application components and identify the required functions and disable or remove those that are notneeded by the application business functions or security functions. This way there is a lower riskwhen using those components and easier to maintain and protecting the application."

			"Description": "Applications have often different ways for granting access to protected resources, sometimes these are done based on a role that is defined in a Database or using an Active Directory permission. Also, externalauthorization services may be implemented and needed for the application. With all these different ways for protecting resources and the access to these assets mistakes will be easily made. ",
			"Solution": "Immplement a centralized mechanism where all the different types of resources and grating access to these resources (including libraries that call external authorization services) are located. This wayit's easier to maintain and the lower the complexity."

			"title": "Third party components",
			"Description": " All third party components the application depends on to operate must be mapped interms of the functions, and/or security functions, they provide for several reasons.1. Whenever one of these dependencies is down the application has to handle the missing of   that dependency gracefully and not break down resulting in a DOS.2. All security functions they provide must be mapped and backed up by a WAF or ModSecurity in case   the dependency goes down for service.",
			"Solution": "Verify that all components that are not part of the application but that the applicationrelies on to operate are defined in terms of the functions, and/or security functions, they provide."

The way we secure the data could be defined by us, but some information it should be made according to a standard  i.e. all applications that manipulate credit card information should comply with one of the pci standards.",
			"Solution": "Identify the list of sensitive data that is being processed by the application.Establish, maintain, and disseminate a security policy for processing and storing sensitive data. If information should be encrypted, separated in another database, etc. If exist, follow the appropriate standard."

			"Description": "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, where an attacker abuse the functionality of avulnerable web application to send crafter request which which read or update internal resources. Attacker can attack an internal network or application behind the firewall withthis attack which is normally not accessible through external network and even attack theinternal network web applications.SSRF attack can be used to make requests to other internal resources for accessing the metadata and to run a port can on the internal network. URL schema such as file:// canbe used to read the file from the server. Attackers can use legacy URL schemas such as dict, gopher, expect etc which can even cause remote code execution.",
			"Solution": "Disable unused URL schemas which are dangerous like expect://, file:///, ftp://, gopher://.Proper whitelisting of domain or IP address which you need to access to. Response received from the internal server should not be shown to the attacker. Some services like Memcached, Redis, Elasticsearch and MongoDB do not require authentication by default, so we need to enable authentication for these services."
